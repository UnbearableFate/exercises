# Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a 
# sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or 
# transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or 
# another computer environment. 
# 
#  Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no 
# restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You 
# just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and this 
# string can be deserialized to the original tree structure. 
# 
#  Clarification: The input/output format is the same as how LeetCode 
# serializes a binary tree. You do not necessarily need to follow this format, so please be 
# creative and come up with different approaches yourself. 
# 
#  
#  Example 1: 
# 
#  
# Input: root = [1,2,3,null,null,4,5]
# Output: [1,2,3,null,null,4,5]
#  
# 
#  Example 2: 
# 
#  
# Input: root = []
# Output: []
#  
# 
#  
#  Constraints: 
# 
#  
#  The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 10‚Å¥]. 
#  -1000 <= Node.val <= 1000
